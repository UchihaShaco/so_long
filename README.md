# so_long <br>
# Project Overview <br>
The so_long project is a 2D game written in C using the minilibx graphics library. The game involves navigating a player character through a maze, collecting objects and avoiding enemies. The objective of the game is to collect all the objects and reach the exit point of the maze. <br>

The so_long project consists of several components: <br>

# Map Parsing <br>
The so_long game uses a map file in a specific format to represent the maze. The map file contains the following symbols: <br>

* 1: Wall <br>
* 0: Floor <br>
* C: Collectible object <br>
* E: Exit point <br>
* P: Player character <br>
The so_long program must read the map file and store the map data in memory. <br>

# Graphics <br>
The so_long game uses the minilibx graphics library to display the game on the screen. The library provides functions for creating windows, drawing images and shapes, and handling user input. <br>

# Game Logic <br>
The so_long game implements the game logic, including player movement, object collection, enemy behavior, and game win/lose conditions. <br>

# Error Handling <br>
The so_long program must handle errors that can occur during map parsing, graphics initialization, and game logic. <br>

# Conclusion <br>
The so_long project is an engaging and challenging project that requires skills in parsing, memory management, graphics programming, and game logic. The project is an excellent exercise for any C programmer interested in game development or graphics programming.
